              <p>Carbon offsetting allows organisations to compensate for their carbon emissions by investing in projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases. This helps mitigate the impact of their carbon footprint.</p>
              <p>Whether youâ€™re looking to offset certain unavoidable emissions or where certain emissions are challenging to eliminate entirely, such as those from business travel or specific industrial processes. Carbon offsetting provides a means to address these emissions while working on longer-term reduction strategies.</p>
              <h4><b>How to Offset and Become Carbon Neutral</b></h4>
              <p><b>Carbon offsetting is easy and takes just 3 Steps!</b></p>
              <p>STEP 1 - Calculate your emissions</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Small Businesses - Register and use our online business calculator</li>
                  <li>Larger Businesses - We offer a consultancy appraisal and verification services</li>
              </ul>
              <p>STEP 2 - Start reducing your emissions</p>
              <p>Identify which specific emissions you want to target/reduce and the amount in tonnes you want to reduce by.</p>
              <p>STEP 3 - Choose an offset project from our portfolio</p>
              <p>Once we understand your offsetting requirements, we will provide you with a number of certified projects to choose from.</p>
              <p>We recognise that choosing high-quality offset projects with verified and additional emissions reductions is crucial to maximise the environmental and social benefits of carbon offsetting, that is why we only support United Nations certified projects that reduce, avoid or remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere. These projects are implemented in developing countries around the world and are rewarded with Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) for each tonne of greenhouse gas they help reduce, avoid or remove.</p>
