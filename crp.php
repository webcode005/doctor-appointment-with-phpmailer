             <p>There are specific guidelines for creating a CRP, and we will support you to include all the required details:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Confirmation of your commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050 for your UK operations</li>
                <li>Provision of current emissions for the sources included in Scope 1 (gas) and 2 (electricity) of the GHG Protocol, and a defined subset of Scope 3 (transport, commute, waste) emissions</li>
                <li>Provision of emissions reporting in CO2e (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent) for the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol4</li>
                <li>Ensuring your key differentiators are prominent throughout the response</li>
                <li>Details of environmental management measures in effect, including certification schemes or specific carbon reduction measures the supplier has adopted, and will be applied when delivering the contract to support achieving Net Zero by 2050</li>
                <li>Approval from the board of directors (or equivalent management body) within 12 months of the date of the procurement</li>
            </ul>
            <h5><b>SCOPES</b></h5>
            <p><b>Scope 1</b> - emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by the reporting organization. e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles.</p>
            <p><b>Scope 2</b> - emissions are indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling. They are accounted for by the reporting organization as they are a result of the organization’s energy use.  </p>
            <p><b>Scope 3</b> - emissions include all sources not within an organization’s scope 1 and 2 boundary. Scope 3 emissions often represent the majority of an organization’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and the CRP is interested in those related to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Business travel</li>
            <li>Employee commuting</li>
            <li>Waste generated in operations</li>
            <li>Upstream transportation and distribution</li>
            <li>Downstream transportation and distribution</li>
            </ul>
