             <p>"Net zero" refers to achieving a balance between the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. It is a critical goal in the fight against climate change. When an organisation or country aims for net zero emissions, it means that it intends to reduce its carbon footprint as much as possible and offset any remaining emissions by investing in activities that remove an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>For organisations and countries, achieving net zero typically involves implementing various measures, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, adopting sustainable practices, promoting carbon capture and storage technologies, and investing in nature-based solutions like afforestation and reforestation.</p>
            <p>The net-zero concept is central to international efforts to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Many countries, organisations, and businesses have set ambitious net-zero targets to contribute to the global effort to combat climate change and create a more sustainable future.</p>
            <p>As the impacts of climate change continue to be felt worldwide, the pursuit of net zero becomes increasingly vital to mitigate its effects, protect the environment, and safeguard future generations.</p>
