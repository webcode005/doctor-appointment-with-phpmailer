             <p>Organisations that transact with the government, whether through contracts, procurement, or other engagements, may have additional responsibilities and regulations to consider concerning climate change and sustainability, including: </p>
             <p>Green Public Procurement (GPP): Governments increasingly encourage or mandate green public procurement, where they prioritize buying goods and services with lower environmental impacts. Organisations transacting with the government may need to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable practices and provide information on the environmental attributes of their products and services.</p>
             <p>Social Value Act: The UK's Social Value Act requires government bodies to consider the social, economic, and environmental benefits of the goods and services they procure. Organisations transacting with the government may need to demonstrate how their offerings align with broader social and environmental objectives.</p>
             <p>Tendering Requirements: Government tenders may include specific criteria related to sustainability and climate change. Organisations bidding for government contracts need to ensure they address these criteria and showcase their environmental credentials in their proposals.</p>
             <p>Reporting and Transparency: Some government contracts require organisations to report on their sustainability performance and progress in meeting environmental objectives. This may involve providing data on carbon emissions, energy efficiency, waste management, and other relevant metrics.</p>
             <p>Compliance with Environmental Standards: Government transactions often require compliance with relevant environmental standards, such as ISO 14001 for environmental management systems or ISO 50001 for energy management systems.</p>
             <p>Climate-Related Risk and Resilience: Organisations engaging with the government may need to assess and disclose their exposure to climate-related risks and demonstrate their resilience to climate change impacts as part of their transactions.</p>
             <p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Demonstrating a strong commitment to CSR, including environmental sustainability, can enhance an organisation's reputation and competitiveness in government transactions.</p>
             <p>In summary, organisations that transact with the government must be prepared to align their operations with specific requirements related to sustainability, climate change, and social value. Integrating environmental considerations into their products, services, and reporting can be instrumental in securing government contracts and partnerships and contributing to broader sustainability goals.</p>
